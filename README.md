# Operating-System-Lab-Work
This repository contains a selection of programs and practical exercises completed during my Operating Systems Lab course (BTCS582) as part of my university curriculum. The work is based on lab assignments provided by my instructors and curated by the university. I’m sharing these programs as a reference resource for learning core OS concepts such as process management, scheduling, file handling, synchronization, memory management, and basic system-level operations.
